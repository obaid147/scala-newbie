Scala has a rich hierarchy of collections in addition to List

                            Traversable(trait)   SuperType

                             iterable(trait) extends Traversable

                 Seq            Set                   Map

Seq, Set and Map are traits they extend iterable trait which extends Traversable trait......

Seq -> Maintains order of insertion.
Set -> Maintains uniqueness but not order (though may be sorted sometimes).
Map -> is a Key -> value association, with unique keys.
