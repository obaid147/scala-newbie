Seq maintains order of insertion
Seq is further divided into two broad categories: LinearSeq and IndexedSeq

1. LinearSeq is optimized for head-first. (eg:- List)
1. IndexedSeq is optimized for random access. (eg:- Vector)

2. Both List and Vector are immutable(cannot be changed).
2. Both of these are widely used depends on below point:-

If we know that we can work exclusively at head(eg: recursion) USE LIST.
For anything else use Vector.

For sheer performance, particularly with primitives, We sometime use Array:-
    1. BUT Array is mutable with no thread safety.
    2. Profile and prove a performance problem before using Array.
