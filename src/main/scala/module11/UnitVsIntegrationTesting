// Unit vs Integration Testing

1. Unit tests are small, self contained and fast, requiring no external resources.
1. Integration tests may use external resources, and are useful for checking a complete system.

2. Neither type of testing is enough without the other.

3. To Unit test, one must often isolate from external resources.

4. This is where fakes, mocks and stubs come in useful.
