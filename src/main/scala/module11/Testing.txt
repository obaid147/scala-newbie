/**Testing took over from pre-conditions, post-conditions
 * and invariants in most development
  Scala has various testing frameworks:
  JUnit
  TestNG
  Specs2
  Scalatest
In the course so far, we have been using Scalatest
Scalatest supports many styles of testing and offers many features*/

// --------------- Scalatest ------------------------
/**
 * Scalatest is a free, open source testing framework that is well documented and widely used.
 * It supports many different styles of tests:
    * http://www.scalatest.org/user_guide/selecting_a_style
 * We will concentrate on a couple of styles:
      FunSuite - very similar to the koans style you have been using throughout the couse
      FunSpec - a more BDD influenced suite for writing specifications
We will also look at the Matchers DSL and support for mocking and property testing
Keep the http://www.scalatest.org/user_guide handy to write your own
(there is lots here)*/
