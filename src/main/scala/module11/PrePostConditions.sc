/**
 * 1. PRECONDITIONS refers to some conditions in scala that needs
      to be fulfilled before moving further with the code/program.

 * 2. Designing by Contract(DbC), is a designing process that
      gives significance and meaning to scala preconditions.

 * 3. Bertrand Meyer, gave the DbC approach and it offers some
      pre and post conditions to a code block which if not
      satisfied, throws an exception.

 * 4. Scala preconditions are a set of major functions that have
      different conditions a programmer must follow while designing
      a software. These functions come in Predef.scala package
      and one does not have to import any separate package.

/**                The exceptions are checked at run time.
 *  Assert â€“ For general assertions:-
    assert() is a method of asserting a condition in all execution
    paths or to check an INVARIANT condition throughout the program.

 *  Assume - Stating an Axiom:-
    assume(), on the other hand, is used to reduce the load on the
    static analyser (debugging that is done by examining the code
    without executing the program.)
    It works locally to develop a divide-and-rule mechanism to help
    the analyzers to assume a condition and go through checking the
    code.
