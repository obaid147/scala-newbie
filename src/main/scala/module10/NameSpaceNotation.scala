/**   Namespace Notation
 * Is not widely uses but illustrates better scoping.
 * It looks like another top level class / object or trait definition.
 * Only traits, classes, and objects can go directly under a package.
 * We cannot use def's and val's directly under a package.
 * Namespace notation also allows multiple different packages in a single
   source file (again, uncommon in Scala)
