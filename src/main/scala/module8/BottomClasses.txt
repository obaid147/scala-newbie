1 null is a concept familiar in many other languages.

2 It can be assigned to any reference type in those languages to denote the
    absence of a reference.

3 "It's as though there is a Null type that is a subclass of all other types,
    with a single null instance" -- Paraphrased from the Java Language Spec.

4 In Scala this is literally the case, Null is a type, it is a subclass of the whole
    set of AnyRefs, and there is a single instance null of that type.

5 There is also a Nothing type which is the subtype of everything in the
    Scala type system. There is no instance of Nothing, nor can there be one.
    It exists solely to complete the type system.
