We use java libraries in scala.

We some libraries make more sense than others.

This includes persistence layers, web frameworks, numerical and
scientific libraries, etc.

Scala uses numerical and scientific libraries which are very useful.

On the other hand, many of these have Scala wrappers around java libs, to make it more scala like.
or we can write our own.
