1. Maven:-
    A talk on build tools cannot be complete without Maven.
    Which is mostly used build tool.

    -> Maven has good support for scala building since zinc came along.
            Uses zinc for incremental compilation.
    -> Maven has support for all sort of languages.

    -> Fast to create Scala Projects:-
        mvn archetype:generate
        mvn clean test
        Spark is one of the library.
    -> Many archetypes including Scala, Akka, Play....etc

2. Gradle:-
    Another popular toll that's been making inroads is greater and greater again has good polyglots support.

    Gradle uses a domain specific language for building written in Groovy and it has a plug in for Scala.

    It's also got zinc, which is the incremental compiler support.

    And it's a lot of people like Gradle very much.

    if you're already using Gradle and you want to include Scala in the belt, it's easy to do.

    Scala plugin: apply plugin: 'scala'

    DSL in Groovy(Domain specific language)
    Support for Zinc:
        tasks.withType(ScalaCompile) {
        scalaCompileOptions.useAnt = false
        }
    Dependency management:
        dependencies {
        testCompile "org.scala-lang:scala-library:2.12.1"
        }

3. Other Options:-
    -> Pants: Twitterâ€™s Open Source Build Tool
        Python DSL

    -> Apache Buildr
        Ruby DSL
        http://buildr.apache.org/
    -> Ant
        XML DSL :-)
