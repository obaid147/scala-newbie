/**
 * Statements, side-effects, vars, and mutability are not functional programming style
 * Instead, aim for expressions, vals and immutability whenever possible
 * Use vars or mutability when dictated by performance or other factors
 * You don't need a var with a mutable collection, instead choose one or the other
 * Don't let mutability escape into the API
 * Don't optimize for performance prematurely
 * Also keep methods short and uncomplicated, separate early and often
