Override concrete members
def, val, lazy val, var might all be overridden in subclasses:

1 def: can be overridden by all kinds of members(def, val, lazy val, and var).

2 val: can only be overridden by val.

3 lazy val: can only be overridden by lazy val.

4 var: a concrete var cannot be overridden.

Override abstract members
lazy val cannot be abstract, so there are only three rules:

1 def: can be overridden by all kinds of members(def, val, lazy val, and var).

2 val: can be overridden by val and lazy val.

3 var: can be overridden by (1) var, or (2) a pair of read and write operations implemented by def, val, or lazy val.

A stable member can only be overridden by a stable member
class X { val stable = 1}
class Y extends X { override var stable = 1 } // error
