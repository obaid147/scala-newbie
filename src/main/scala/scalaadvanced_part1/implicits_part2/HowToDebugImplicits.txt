1.  Don't overuse implicits, and we won't need to debug them as much.

2. Before trying implicitly, Try applying the implicit method (or parameter) explicitly and see what
    the compiler says.

3. Check for conflicting implicits. (Scala won't choose - no ambiguity allowed).

4. scalac -Xprint:typer or scalac -Ybrowse:typer to see the desugaring.

5. Also desugar in ammonite can help.
